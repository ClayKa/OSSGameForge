## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We use:
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting
- [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking

Run `make format` to automatically format your code.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

We use:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting

Run `npm run format` in the frontend directory.

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Testing

* Write unit tests for all new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for >80% code coverage
* Include integration tests for API endpoints
* Add E2E tests for critical user workflows

## Documentation

* Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
