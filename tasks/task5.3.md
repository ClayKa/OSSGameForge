#### **Phase 1: Pre-Submission Asset Consolidation and Checklist**

**Goal:** To gather all required submission materials in one place and perform a final cross-check against the official rules to ensure nothing has been missed.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.1: Create a Final Submission Checklist**
    *   **Action:** The Project Lead will create a new, temporary document (e.g., in Google Docs or a `submission_checklist.md` file).
    *   **Action:** Go to the official hackathon website and copy-paste the *exact* list of submission requirements into this checklist document. Do not rely on memory.
    *   **Example Checklist:**
        - [ ] Project Name: `OSSGameForge`
        - [ ] Team Member Names & Roles
        - [ ] Project Description (Text)
        - [ ] Category Choice(s) & Justification (Text)
        - [ ] Public Code Repository URL
        - [ ] 3-Minute Demonstration Video URL
        - [ ] (Any other specific fields required by the platform)
    *   **Rationale:** A physical checklist prevents simple, costly omissions. It turns an abstract goal ("submit the project") into a concrete set of verifiable items.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.2: Consolidate Final Assets**
    *   **Action:** The Project Lead will gather the final, approved versions of all assets and place their links or content directly into the checklist document.
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  **Video:** Upload the final `.mp4` video from Task 5.2 to a public platform like YouTube (as "Unlisted") or Vimeo. Get the final, shareable URL. Paste it into the checklist.
        2.  **Repository URL:** Copy the URL of your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/ClayKa/oss-game-forge`. Paste it into the checklist.
        3.  **Project Description:** Draft the final ~300-word project description in the checklist document. This can be adapted from the `README.md`.
        4.  **Category Justification:** Draft the text explaining your choice of categories (e.g., "We are submitting to 'Local Agent' because...").
    *   **Rationale:** This step centralizes all information. When it's time to fill out the form, it will be a simple copy-and-paste operation, reducing the chance of typos or grabbing the wrong link under pressure.

#### **Phase 2: The "Two-Person Rule" Submission Process**

**Goal:** To execute the actual submission with a robust, two-person review process to catch any final errors.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.3: The Submitter Fills Out the Form**
    *   **Action:** Schedule a specific time for submission, ideally at least 24 hours before the absolute final deadline to avoid last-minute platform slowdowns.
    *   **Action:** The Project Lead (the "Submitter") will open the official hackathon submission form.
    *   **Action:** The Submitter will have the `submission_checklist.md` document open side-by-side. They will methodically copy each piece of information from the checklist and paste it into the corresponding field on the submission form. **Do not type directly into the form if you can avoid it.**
    *   **Rationale:** The copy-paste method minimizes data entry errors. Submitting early avoids the risk of server crashes or slow uploads that often happen in the final hours of a competition.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.4: The Reviewer Verifies the Form**
    *   **Action:** Before clicking the final "Submit" button, the Submitter will initiate a short video call and share their screen with the designated "Final Reviewer."
    *   **Action:** The Reviewer will have their own copy of the `submission_checklist.md` open.
    *   **Reviewer's Checklist:**
        1.  "Read me the Project Name from the form." -> *Verifier checks it matches the checklist.*
        2.  "Click on the video link from the form preview. Does it open the correct video?" -> *Verifier confirms.*
        3.  "Click on the repository link. Does it go to the correct repo?" -> *Verifier confirms.*
        4.  "I'm reading the project description from the checklist. Does it match what's on the screen word-for-word?" -> *Verifier confirms.*
    *   **Action:** The Reviewer gives a verbal "Go ahead" once every single field has been verified.
    *   **Rationale:** This "two-person rule" is standard practice for critical operations. A second set of eyes is invaluable for catching small mistakes that the person doing the work might overlook.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.5: Final Submission and Confirmation**
    *   **Action:** After receiving the verbal "Go ahead," the Submitter clicks the final "Submit" button.
    *   **Action:** Wait for the confirmation page or success message to appear on the screen.
    *   **Action:** Take a full-screen screenshot of this confirmation page, which should ideally include a submission ID or timestamp.
    *   **Action:** Save the screenshot with a clear filename (e.g., `OSSGameForge_Submission_Confirmation.png`) and post it in the team's primary communication channel (e.g., Slack, Discord).
    *   **Rationale:** The screenshot is your official, undeniable proof of a timely submission in case of any platform disputes or glitches.

#### **Phase 3: Post-Submission Celebration**

**Goal:** To formally recognize the team's hard work and dedication over the past six weeks and to close out the project on a positive, high note.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.6: Announce the Successful Submission**
    *   **Action:** The Project Lead posts the confirmation screenshot in the team channel with a message.
        > "@all: It's done. OSSGameForge has been successfully submitted! An incredible effort by everyone over the past six weeks. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication."
    *   **Rationale:** This provides a definitive and celebratory moment of closure for the entire team.

*   **Sub-Task 5.3.7: Schedule the Celebration**
    *   **Action:** Immediately schedule a team-wide video call or (if possible) an in-person get-together for the end of the day or the following day.
    *   **Action:** This event is strictly for celebrating. No "post-mortems" or "what-ifs." The purpose is to relax, share favorite moments from the hackathon, and acknowledge each other's contributions.
    *   **Rationale:** Celebrating success is crucial for team morale and motivation. It validates the intense effort and reinforces the positive aspects of the collaboration, making team members eager to work together again in the future.
