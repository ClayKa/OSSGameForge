### **Task Plan: 5.1 - Final Bug Bash & Stability Hardening (Expanded Detail)**

**Objective:** To systematically identify, prioritize, and eliminate critical defects in the core MVP workflow. This will be achieved by conducting structured usability tests with external users, followed by a focused, team-wide effort to resolve the most impactful issues. The goal is to transform our functional prototype into a stable, polished, and robust demonstration vehicle.

**[Priority]** [MUST]
**[Owner / Suggested Roles]** QA Lead (as coordinator), with All Team Members participating.

#### **Phase 1: User Testing Preparation and Execution**

**Goal:** To gather high-quality, unbiased feedback on the end-to-end user experience from individuals outside the development team.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.1: Recruit External Testers**
    *   **Action:** Identify and reach out to 3-5 individuals who fit our target user profile (e.g., game design students, indie developers, friends with a technical background).
    *   **Communication:** Send a short, clear invitation.
        > "Hi [Name], we're in the final stages of a hackathon project building a new game creation tool. Would you have 30-45 minutes this week to test it out and give us some honest feedback? We'll guide you through the whole process. Your input would be incredibly valuable!"
    *   **Action:** Schedule a specific 45-minute slot for each tester using a tool like Calendly or by direct coordination.
    *   **Rationale:** External testers provide fresh eyes. They are not biased by knowing "how it's supposed to work" and are more likely to uncover usability issues that the team has become blind to.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.2: Prepare the User Testing Protocol**
    *   **Action:** Create a document named `docs/user_testing_protocol.md`. This script will be read by the test facilitator to ensure every test session is consistent.
    *   **Content:**
        1.  **Introduction (5 mins):**
            *   "Thank you for your time. We're testing an early prototype."
            *   "There are no right or wrong answers. We are testing the tool, not you. Please think aloud and tell us what you're seeing and expecting."
            *   "We will be recording the session for note-taking purposes. Is that okay with you?"
        2.  **Scenario & Tasks (25 mins):**
            *   **Context:** "Imagine you have an idea for a simple platformer game."
            *   **Task 1: Setup:** "Please clone our project and run the demo script as instructed in the README." (This tests our one-click demo script).
            *   **Task 2: Content Creation:** "Now that it's running, please upload one of the provided asset files (e.g., `player.png`)."
            *   **Task 3: Generation:** "Use the UI to generate a new scene."
            *   **Task 4: Interaction:** "In the viewer, please select and move one of the platforms."
            *   **Task 5: Export:** "Now, please export this scene as an HTML5 package."
            *   **Task 6: Verification:** "Finally, unzip the downloaded file and open the `index.html` to see if it worked."
        3.  **Post-session Q&A (10 mins):**
            *   "What was the most confusing part of that process?"
            *   "Was there anything that surprised you?"
            *   "On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to recommend a tool like this to a friend? (NPS Score)"
    *   **Rationale:** A consistent protocol ensures that the feedback from all testers is comparable. Open-ended questions encourage qualitative insights beyond simple bug reports.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.3: Conduct the Testing Sessions**
    *   **Action:** During the scheduled time, the facilitator shares their screen or has the user share theirs over a video call (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom). A second team member should act as a silent "note-taker."
    *   **Facilitator's Role:** Read the script. Resist the urge to help the user immediately if they get stuck. Instead, ask "What are you expecting to happen here?" Record the point of confusion.
    *   **Note-Taker's Role:** Use a shared document or spreadsheet. For each tester, log:
        *   Direct quotes (e.g., "I don't know where to click to generate").
        *   Observed pain points (e.g., "User clicked the wrong button 3 times").
        *   Bugs encountered (e.g., "Export failed with a 500 error").
        *   Their final NPS score and qualitative answers.
    *   **Rationale:** This formal process captures rich, actionable data that is more valuable than just a list of bugs.

#### **Phase 2: Triage and Bug Fixing Sprint**

**Goal:** To systematically process the user feedback and dedicate a focused block of time to resolving the most critical issues.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.4: Triage and Prioritize Issues**
    *   **Action:** Schedule a 1-hour "Triage Meeting" after all user tests are complete.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Review all notes from the testing sessions.
        2.  For each identified issue, create a new ticket in your GitHub Issues.
        3.  Give each ticket a descriptive title (e.g., "[UI] 'Generate' button is hard to find").
        4.  **Prioritize:** Label each issue with one of two tags:
            *   `P0 - Critical Bug`: An issue that breaks the core `Upload -> Generate -> View -> Export -> Run` loop or causes a crash. **These MUST be fixed.**
            *   `P1 - Usability Friction`: An issue that causes significant confusion but doesn't technically break the application (e.g., confusing labels, slow load time). **These SHOULD be fixed.**
        5.  Assign each `P0` and `P1` ticket to a specific team member.
    *   **Rationale:** Triage is essential for focus. It prevents the team from getting distracted by minor issues and ensures that engineering effort is directed at problems that have the biggest impact on the user experience and demo quality.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.5: Execute the "Bug Bash" Sprint**
    *   **Action:** Announce a "feature freeze." For the next 3-4 days, the team's *only* priority is to work on and close the `P0` and `P1` tickets from the triage meeting.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Each developer works on their assigned tickets on a separate feature branch.
        2.  When a fix is ready, they open a Pull Request.
        3.  The PR description must link to the issue it resolves (e.g., "Fixes #27").
        4.  Another team member must review the PR to confirm the fix works and doesn't introduce new problems.
        5.  The PR can only be merged if the CI pipeline passes.
    *   **Rationale:** This highly focused, sprint-like approach creates momentum and ensures that the most critical issues are addressed quickly and with high quality.

#### **Phase 3: Final Regression Testing and Verification**

**Goal:** To ensure that the bug fixes have not introduced any new problems and that the application as a whole is now more stable.

*   **Sub-Task 5.1.6: Perform Full Regression Testing**
    *   **Action:** Once all `P0` tickets are closed, the QA lead will perform a full end-to-end regression test. This involves running through the entire user testing protocol one more time themselves.
    *   **Action:** The automated CI tests on the `main` branch are the most critical part of this step. After each fix is merged, the team must monitor the CI run on `main` to ensure that:
        *   The backend unit tests still pass.
        *   The generation pipeline test (using golden samples) still passes.
        *   The E2E browser smoke test still passes.
        *   The visual consistency test still passes.
    *   **Rationale:** This final check verifies the integrity of the entire system. It confirms that the fixes were successful and that they did not have unintended side effects, a common problem in rapid development cycles.

#### **Acceptance Criteria / Final State Verification**

Upon completion of this task plan:

1.  **User Feedback is Incorporated:** Actionable feedback from at least 3 external user tests has been logged, triaged, and addressed.
2.  **Critical Bugs are Resolved:** All `P0` tickets that prevent a user from successfully completing the core `Upload -> Generate -> View -> Export -> Run` workflow have been closed and verified.
3.  **Stability is Increased:** The application is demonstrably more stable and user-friendly than it was at the beginning of the week.
4.  **No Regressions Introduced:** The full suite of automated CI tests on the `main` branch is consistently passing, proving that the bug fixes have not broken existing functionality.
